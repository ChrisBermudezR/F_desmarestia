	abstract = {A review of zooplankton studies conducted in Peruvian marine waters is given. After a short history of the development of zooplankton research off Peru, we review zooplankton methodology, taxonomy, biodiversity, spatial distribution, seasonal and interannual variability, trophodynamics, secondary production, and modelling. We review studies on several micro-, meso-, macro-, and meroplankton groups, and give a species list from both published and unpublished reports. Three regional zooplankton groups have been identiﬁed: (1) a continental shelf group dominated by Acartia tonsa and Centropages brachiatus; (2) a continental slope group characterized by siphonophores, bivalves, foraminifera and radiolaria; (3) and a species-rich oceanic group. The highest zooplankton abundances and biomasses were often found between 4–6°S and 14–16°S, where continental shelves are narrow. Species composition changes with distance from the shore. Species composition and biomass also vary strongly on short time scales due to advection, peaks of larval production, trophic interactions, and community succession. The relation of zooplankton to climatic variability ({ENSO} and multi-decadal) and ﬁsh stocks is discussed in the context of ecological regime shifts. An intermediate upwelling hypothesis is proposed, based on the negative effects of low upwelling intensity in summer or extremely strong and enduring winter upwelling on zooplankton abundance off Peru. According to this hypothesis, intermediate upwelling creates an optimal environmental window for zooplankton communities. Finally, we highlight important knowledge gaps that warrant attention in future.},

	abstract = {Pteropods are a group of holoplanktonic gastropods for which global biomass distribution patterns remain poorly described. The aim of this study was to collect and synthesise existing pteropod (Gymnosomata, Thecosomata and Pseudothecosomata) abundance and biomass data, in order to evaluate the global distribution of pteropod carbon biomass, with a particular emphasis on temporal and spatial patterns. We collected 25 939 data points from several online databases and 41 scientiﬁc articles. These data points corresponded to observations from 15 134 stations, where 93 \% of observations were of shelled pteropods (Thecosomata) and 7 \% of non-shelled pteropods (Gymnosomata). The biomass data has been gridded onto a 360 × 180◦ grid, with a vertical resolution of 33 depth levels. Both the raw data ﬁle and the gridded data in {NetCDF} format can be downloaded from {PANGAEA}, doi:10.1594/{PANGAEA}.777387. Data were collected between 1950–2010, with sampling depths ranging from 0–2000 m. Pteropod biomass data was either extracted directly or derived through converting abundance to biomass with pteropod-speciﬁc length to carbon biomass conversion algorithms. In the Northern Hemisphere ({NH}), the data were distributed quite evenly throughout the year, whereas sampling in the Southern Hemisphere ({SH}) was biased towards winter and summer values. 86 \% of all biomass values were located in the {NH}, most (37 \%) within the latitudinal band of 30–60◦ N. The range of global biomass values spanned over four orders of magnitude, with mean and median (non-zero) biomass values of 4.6 mg C m−3 ({SD} = 62.5) and 0.015 mg C m−3, respectively. The highest mean biomass was located in the {SH} within the 70–80◦ S latitudinal band (39.71 mg C m−3, {SD} = 93.00), while the highest median biomass was in the {NH}, between 40–50◦ S (0.06 mg C m−3, {SD} = 79.94). Shelled pteropods constituted a mean global carbonate biomass of 23.17 mg {CaCO}3 m−3 (based on non-zero records). Total biomass values were lowest in the equatorial regions and equally high at both poles. Pteropods were found at least to depths of 1000 m, with the highest biomass values located in the surface layer (0–10 m) and gradually decreasing with depth, with values in excess of 100 mg C m−3 only found above 200 m depth.},

Plankton samples were taken at 28 sampling stations below the 18°N parallel in the southernmost Gulf of Mexico, during May and November 1995. Five vertical strata (0-6, 6-12, 12-18, 45-55 and 95-105 m) were sampled with an opening-closing net system equipped with 75-cm diameter and 505-µm mesh size nets, and a total of 187 samples were collected. Fourteen species of heteropod Mollusks were identified, and the dominant species, accounting for the 97\% of the total abundance, were Atlanta lesueurii (60\%), A. gaudichaudi (15\%), Firoloida desmarestia (12\%) and A. selvagensis (10\%). In the vertical plane, their highest densities were recorded in the 0-18 m upper layer. Seasonally, only A. gaudichaudi registered its highest abundance in November. We hypothesize that shifts in seasonal dominance of heteropod species is an ecological strategy to avoid competition for feeding resources. The carinariid Carinaria challengeri was registered for the first time in the western Atlantic. A detailed documentation of the worldwide distribution of the 14 heteropod species is included.},

We investigated the ecology of infection (prevalence, intensity, and abundance) in Firoloida desmarestia, caught during two sampling campaign sessions in 2012, off the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico ({IMECOCAL}, 83 stations) and a coastal research center near La Sorpresa Beach, Baja California Sur, in the Gulf of California (14 stations). Only females of F. desmarestia were parasitized. Hemiuroidea parthenita rediae infected 1\% of F. desmarestia population at {IMECOCAL}, whereas young unencysted metacercariae stages of Opechona pyriformis (Lepocreadiidae) parasitized 6.6\% of the same host species at La Sorpresa. Overall, finding of rediae and metacercariae represent new geographical and host records and shows that F. desmarestia has a dual host function in the life cycle of trematodes. As first intermediate host, F. desmarestia harbors hemiuroid rediae, functioning as the source of infection to other zooplanktonic groups by dispersing successive cercariae. As second intermediate hosts, it harbors infective unencysted metacercariae stages of O. pyriformis, which parasitize nektonic predators (fish), most likely through trophic interaction. Our results suggest that some trematodes are able to spend their entire life cycle infecting only pelagic hosts. Parasite–F. desmarestia interaction is shown in a conceptual model, where we propose that transmission of trematodes may occur between individuals of F. desmarestia within the same swarm. Relevance of F. desmarestia as a potential host in which life cycle abbreviation of trematodes may take place is discussed. This is the first quantitative study of helminth interaction on F. desmarestia in the Eastern Pacific.},

The results show 15 range extensions, including Atlanta californiensis and Carinaria japonica which were previously considered as endemic to the Transition Zone waters of the California Current, and Limacina helicina which was thought to only inhabit polar and subpolar waters. Atlanta gibbosa and Creseis chierchiae f. constricta are two new records for the American Paciﬁc. The use of holoplanktonic molluscs as indicators of water masses is a common practice; however, these reported range extensions limit the validity of their use as indicators, at least within the environmental parameters established in previous studies. Although the 40 species found represent only 43\% of the species recorded for the Paciﬁc Ocean, it is noted that this species richness only represents summer conditions and an increase could be expected if sampling was extended to winter.},

A total of 395 individuals were collected with an opening−closing net at 5 levels of the 105 m upper water column. Results indicated that the species reproduces throughout the year, with a reproductive peak in May and a low reproductive period from August to February. Length measurements indicated that females (as long as 30 mm) are larger than males (18 mm). Estimations of a ‘spatial overlap’ index showed a high overlap degree between sexes, suggesting that patterns in their vertical distribution are not a reproductive barrier. Sex ratio (F:M) at birth seemed to be 1:1, but during most of the year the adult sex ratio was dominated by females. We propose that larger dimensions and faster swimming speeds of females provide competitive advantages over males in searching for food and avoiding predators. Simulations of mate encounters indicated that values during the low reproductive season were low under turbulent and nonturbulent conditions ({\textless} 4.9 males d−1 female−1), but enough to fertilize a high percentage of females. During the high reproductive season, encounters were as high as 17.2 males d−1 female−1 because the high density of adult population and the influence of wind-induced turbulence. We suggest that some biological features of females (seminal receptacle and exocrine gland) compensate for the low encounter rates. A conceptual model for the population dynamics of F. desmarestia is proposed.},

Two species (Atlanta fusca and Oxygyrus keraudreni) were restricted to the upper 90 m of the water column a n d were captured in low numbers. Five species (A.lesueuri, A. inflata, Firoloida desmaresti, A. helicinoides and A. oligogyra) ranged from the surface to 140 m during either or both diel periods. There were no evident diel differences in vertical distribution among these species, with the exception of A. helicinoides, which appeared to undergo a limited upward migration at night. Three species (Protatlanta souleyeti, A. turriculata and A. plana) had daytime distributions extending to 200 m. Limited upward migrations at night were suggested for the latter 2 species. Lastly, 3 species (Pterotrachea hippocampus, A. peroni and A. meteori) ranged below 200 m during the day. These species achieved the largest sizes recorded in this study in their respective families, and exhibited upward nocturnal migrations. A series of 6 oblique, open-net tows to a target depth of 50 m with 70 cm Bongo nets and a 4 m Lring net suggested that several species are capable of daytime net avoidance, implying that the low daytime densities recorded for these species from shallow waters during the vertical distribution study could have represented, at least in part, sampling artifacts. Results of this study suggest that the majority of Hawailan heteropods are small non-migrators that dwell In the upper 140 m of the water column. This distributional pattern is supported by in situ behavioral observations on shallow-water atlantids, whlch indlcate that these animals are active during the day and inactive a t night. In contrast, the species of heteropods that ranged the deepest in the water column attained the largest sizes and underwent upward, nocturnal vertical migrations. The migrating members of these populations may feed at night on bioluminescent prey.},

In the Atlantidae the diploid chromosome number was the same in males and females and there were no heteromorphic chromosomes. The diploid chromosome number in nine species of Atlanta was 30 and the majority of chromosome pairs were metacentric and submetacentric. In Protatlanta souleyeti the diploid number was 28, and included five metacentric, six submetacentric, and three subtelocentric chromosome pairs. Oxygyrus keraudreni had a diploid chromosome number of 32, with 10 metacentric and 6 submetacentric chromosome pairs. A striking difference between the Atlantidae and the Carinariidae and {\textasciitilde}tkrotracheidaewas the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes in the latter two families. Male Pterosoma planum (2n = 32) had simple {XY} sex chromosomes, but males of Carinaria japonica (2n = 33), Pterotrachea scutata (2n = 33), Pterotrachea hippocampus (2n = 3 1), and Firoloida desmaresti (2n = 3 1) showed three heteromorphic chromosomes, suggesting a multiple sex-determining mechanism, X,X,Y. The locations of the female sex chromosomes in the karyotypes of female Pterotrachea hippocampus (2n = 32) and Firoloida desmaresti (2n = 32) were tentatively proposed. Cytogenetic features observed among the three families are supportive of previous interpretations of evolutionary trends in the Heteropoda based on morphology, i.e., that the Atlantidae are the most primitive family and gave rise to the Carinariidae and Pterotracheidae.},

	abstract = {The continuous plankton recorder ({CPR}) survey is the largest multi-decadal plankton monitoring programme in the world. It was initiated in 1931 and by the end of 2004 had counted 207,619 samples and identiﬁed 437 phyto- and zooplankton taxa throughout the North Atlantic. {CPR} data are used extensively by the research community and in recent years have been used increasingly to underpin marine management. Here, we take a critical look at how best to use {CPR} data. We ﬁrst describe the {CPR} itself, {CPR} sampling, and plankton counting procedures. We discuss the spatial and temporal biases in the Survey, summarise environmental data that have not previously been available, and describe the new data access policy. We supply information essential to using {CPR} data, including descriptions of each {CPR} taxonomic entity, the idiosyncrasies associated with counting many of the taxa, the logic behind taxonomic changes in the Survey, the semi-quantitative nature of {CPR} sampling, and recommendations on choosing the spatial and temporal scale of study. This forms the basis for a broader discussion on how to use {CPR} data for deriving ecologically meaningful indices based on size, functional groups and biomass that can be used to support research and management. This contribution should be useful for plankton ecologists, modellers and policy makers that actively use {CPR} data.},

After a short history of the development of zooplankton research off Peru, we review zooplankton methodology, taxonomy, biodiversity, spatial distribution, seasonal and interannual variability, trophodynamics, secondary production, and modelling. We review studies on several micro-, meso-, macro-, and meroplankton groups, and give a species list from both published and unpublished reports. Three regional zooplankton groups have been identiﬁed: (1) a continental shelf group dominated by Acartia tonsa and Centropages brachiatus; (2) a continental slope group characterized by siphonophores, bivalves, foraminifera and radiolaria; (3) and a species-rich oceanic group. The highest zooplankton abundances and biomasses were often found between 4–6°S and 14–16°S, where continental shelves are narrow. Species composition changes with distance from the shore. Species composition and biomass also vary strongly on short time scales due to advection, peaks of larval production, trophic interactions, and community succession. The relation of zooplankton to climatic variability ({ENSO} and multi-decadal) and ﬁsh stocks is discussed in the context of ecological regime shifts. An intermediate upwelling hypothesis is proposed, based on the negative effects of low upwelling intensity in summer or extremely strong and enduring winter upwelling on zooplankton abundance off Peru. According to this hypothesis, intermediate upwelling creates an optimal environmental window for zooplankton communities. Finally, we highlight important knowledge gaps that warrant attention in future.},

	abstract = {The atlantid heteropods are regularly encountered, but rarely studied marine planktonic gastropods. Relying on a small ({\textless} 14 mm), delicate aragonite shell and living in the upper ocean means that, in common with pteropods, atlantids are likely to be aﬀected by imminent ocean changes. Variable shell morphology and widespread distributions indicate that the family is more diverse than the 23 currently known species. Uncovering this diversity is fundamental to determining the distribution of atlantids and to understanding their environmental tolerances. Here we present phylogenetic analyses of all described species of the family Atlantidae using 437 new and 52 previously published cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtCO}1) sequences. Specimens and published sequences were gathered from 32 Atlantic Ocean stations, 14 Indian Ocean stations and 21 Paciﬁc Ocean stations between 35°N and 43°S. {DNA} barcoding and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery ({ABGD}) proved to be valuable tools for the identiﬁcation of described atlantid species, and also revealed ten additional distinct clades, suggesting that the diversity within this family has been underestimated. Only two of these clades displayed obvious morphological characteristics, demonstrating that much of the newly discovered diversity is hidden from morphology-based identiﬁcation techniques. Investigation of six large atlantid collections demonstrated that 61\% of previously described (morpho) species have a circumglobal distribution. Of the remaining 39\%, two species were restricted to the Atlantic Ocean, ﬁve occurred in the Indian and Paciﬁc oceans, one species was only found in the northeast Paciﬁc Ocean, and one occurred only in the Southern Subtropical Convergence Zone. Molecular analysis showed that seven of the species with wide distributions were comprised of two or more clades that occupied distinct oceanographic regions. These distributions may suggest narrower environmental tolerances than the described morphospecies. Results provide an updated biogeography and {mtCO}1 reference dataset of the Atlantidae that may be used to identify atlantid species and provide a ﬁrst step in understanding their evolutionary history and accurate distribution, encouraging the inclusion of this family in future plankton research.},

Zooplankton collections were made from the surface to 5,000 meters during April, 2006 on the R/V R.H. Brown. Samples were examined by a ship-board team of morphological taxonomists; {DNA} barcoding was carried out in both ship-board and land-based {DNA} sequencing laboratories. {DNA} barcodes were determined for a total of 297 individuals of 175 holozooplankton species in four phyla, including: Cnidaria (Hydromedusae, 4 species; Siphonophora, 47); Arthropoda (Amphipoda, 10; Copepoda, 34; Decapoda, 9; Euphausiacea, 10; Mysidacea, 1; Ostracoda, 27); and Mollusca (Cephalopoda, 8; Heteropoda, 6; Pteropoda, 15); and Chaetognatha (4). Thirty species of ﬁsh (Teleostei) were also barcoded. For all seven zooplankton groups for which sufﬁcient data were available, Kimura-2-Parameter genetic distances were signiﬁcantly lower between individuals of the same species (mean ¼ 0.0114; S.D. 0.0117) than between individuals of different species within the same group (mean ¼0.3166; S.D. 0.0378). This difference, known as the barcode gap, ensures that {mtCOI} sequences are reliable characters for species identiﬁcation for the oceanic holozooplankton assemblage. In addition, {DNA} barcodes allow recognition of new or undescribed species, reveal cryptic species within known taxa, and inform phylogeographic and population genetic studies of geographic variation. The growing database of ‘‘gold standard’’ {DNA} barcodes serves as a Rosetta Stone for marine zooplankton, providing the key for decoding species diversity by linking species names, morphology, and {DNA} sequence variation. In light of the pivotal position of zooplankton in ocean food webs, their usefulness as rapid responders to environmental change, and the increasing scarcity of taxonomists, the use of {DNA} barcodes is an important and useful approach for rapid analysis of species diversity and distribution in the pelagic community.},

	abstract = {There are few studies on pelagic mollusks from the California Current, despite their ecological importance and vulnerability to climate change (e.g., ocean acidiﬁcation and hypoxia). We analyzed abundances of holoplanktonic mollusks during three years (2006-2008) along a transect-line parallel to the Baja California coast. The main differences in physical factors were increasing temperature and salinity from north to south, and lower dissolved oxygen concentration south of Punta Eugenia (28°N). The lowest oxygen concentrations occurred in summer, with hypoxic conditions ({\textless} 0.5 ml · L-1) in the upper 100 m depth at some locations. Planktonic mollusk abundance did not differ along the latitudinal gradient, excepting Desmopterus paciﬁcus Essenberg, 1919 and individuals from the genus Pterotrachea Forskal, 1775. In contrast, the temporal variability was high, mainly in a seasonal scale but also among years. The inﬂuence of El Niño 2006-2007 and La Niña 2007-2008 were evident by a sharp increase of Corolla spectabilis Dall, 1871 in April 2007 during the El Niño-La Niña transition. During 2008, pelagic mollusks remained with moderate abundance in winter-spring despite the high chlorophyll concentrations recorded (up to 3.26 mg · m-3). Subsequently, during the relaxation of a ﬁrst pulse of La Niña in July 2008, there was a rebound in the abundance of the heteropod Atlanta Lesueur, 1817. and individuals in the Order Gymnosomata. The oxygen gradient inversely inﬂuenced mollusk abundance in most of the genera (Clio Linnaeus, 1767, Limacina Bosc, 1817, Atlanta, and Firoloida Lesueur, 1817) and the order Gymnosomata, but for Cavolinia Abildgaard, 1791, Creseis Rang, 1828, Desmopterus, and Pterotrachea, the salinity gradient was more inﬂuential. Therefore, holoplanktonic mollusks genera were useful indicators of climatic variability.},

In this paper we report the first record of the heteropod Firoloida desmarestia Lesueur (1817) on waters off the Northeast Brazilian continental slope and Fernando de Noronha Archipelago and extend its geographic distribution in the tropical Atlantic. We provide new detailed digital image and descriptions of this highly fragile and transparent gelatinous species. Samples were taken in the context of the ‘{ABRACOS}’ (Acoustic along the Brazilian Coast) project using bongo nets. Out of 96 samples analyzed, six specimens were recorded in five samples, three at Fernando de Noronha, and three off the Northeast Brazilian coast. The present study extends the range of distribution of F. desmarestia to 3°S-9°Sin the western the Tropical Atlantic and highlights the importance of detailed studies on large-sized gelatinous plankton biodiversity in tropical oceans.},

This study presen micropaleontological analysis of three exceptionally well-preserved Late Pleistocene marine sediment cores from the eastern Carib Sea, western Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. This study presents the first stratigraphical record of heteropods in the Cari Sea and extends the known zonation of pteropods in the Mediterranean Sea. Distributions of pteropods, heteropods and plank foraminifera are presented with abundance and species richness data, as well as stratigraphical dates inferred from the oxygen is stratigraphy, argon-argon dating and biostratigraphy. The findings of this study greatly improve our understanding of holoplank gastropod stratigraphy and ecology. Results reveal that the geographical range of heteropods, thought to be restricted to sub-tro warm waters, may be much greater, including waters of sub-polar temperature. Heteropods were also found to be surprisingly abun potentially representing a more important part of the ocean food web than previously thought. Analysis revealed two speci holoplanktonic gastropod that are previously undescribed and indicate that the pteropod Heliconoides mermuysi (Cahuzac and Jan 2010), known exclusively from the Moulin de Cabanes (Miocene), may have lived in the Caribbean Sea and Indian Ocean as recently kyr ago. These findings highlight the urgent need for increased research on holoplanktonic gastropods. The threat that current cli change and ocean acidification poses, particularly to the delicately shelled forms, means that some species may become extinct be they have even been fully 'discovered'.},
